## How to Use This List

Start with the first book of the [Essential Path](#essential-path), and after finish it, read the next one. Repeat this process until you finish all books from the Essential Path.

After you complete the Essential Path, you should keep studying! Just choose one book that is listed in our [Additional Resources](#additional-resources) section. You don't need to read those books in such section in order, you should pick the one that you are most interested! :smile:

**PROTIP**: try to **create** and **deploy** at least one practical project after you finish each book.

## Project Based

In order to show for everyone that you successfully finished a book, you should create a new project.

> "What does it mean?"

After finish a book, you should think about a **real world** problem that you can solve using the acquired knowledge in such book. You don't need to create a big project, but you must create something to **validate** and **consolidate** your knowledge, and also to show to the world that you are capable to create something useful with the concepts that you learned.

The projects of all students will be listed in our [JavaScript Projects](https://github.com/javascript-society/javascript-projects) repository. Submit a pull request with your project's information after you start/conclude it.

You can create this project alone or with colleagues!
